- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bobble25
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python, Java Script, and Html
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python through a few free courses and camps, through Udemy and Data Camp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything for anybody that will allow me apply the code that I do know, to learn more and most of what I don't yet know.
- 📫 How to reach me is through instagram bobble25 via dm or twitter at bobblehead25 or on here.
